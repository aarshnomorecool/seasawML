|-------|--------------|--------|
| 1 | Data Ingestion (GOES + Wind + GRASP) | ✅ Complete |
| 2 | Preprocessing (spikes, gaps, log transform, scaling) | ✅ Complete |
| 3 | Feature Engineering (Dynamic Lag, lag/rolling/EMA/delta features) | ✅ Complete |
| 4 | Multi-Horizon Dataset Builder (3 chronological train/val/test splits) | ✅ Complete |
| 5 | Model Training (XGBoost + LSTM per horizon) | ✅ Complete |
| 6 | Weighted Ensemble (α-blend of XGBoost + LSTM) | ✅ Complete |
| 7 | Validation against GRASP (Indian-longitude ground truth) | ✅ Built, blocked on data |
| 8 | Streamlit Dashboard | ✅ Complete |

Phases 1-6 and 8 are implemented and have been run end-to-end on one real month (March 2015)
of GOES/Wind data pulled live from NASA CDAWeb, including full retraining and dashboard
verification. Phase 7 is built and tested (synthetic data) but currently blocked on GRASP
ground truth, which requires a manual download from ISRO's PRADAN portal (see Data Sources).
Ready to scale to a full multi-year dataset.

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Requires: `cdflib`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `scipy`, `scikit-learn`, `xgboost`, `tensorflow`,
`matplotlib`, `plotly`, `streamlit`. For automated data fetching, also:
`pip install cdasws requests tqdm`.

### Getting the data

**Automated (Wind + GOES):**
```bash
python -m src.ingestion.auto_fetcher --start 2013-01-01 --end 2024-01-01
```
Downloads Wind MFI, Wind SWE, and GOES-13/15/16 CDF files directly from NASA CDAWeb / NOAA.
See `TRAINING_GUIDE.md` for the full walkthrough, including 1-year smoke-test recommendations
before committing to an 11-year fetch.

**Manual (GRASP/GSAT - ISRO PRADAN):**
Register at [pradan.issdc.gov.in](https://pradan.issdc.gov.in/), download ZIPs for
Data → GSAT → date range, and place them (un-extracted) in `data/raw/grasp/`.

Before running Phase 1, inspect at least one file from each source:
```bash
python -m src.ingestion.cdf_inspector data/raw/goes/<file>.cdf
python -m src.ingestion.cdf_inspector data/raw/wind_mfi/<file>.cdf
python -m src.ingestion.cdf_inspector data/raw/wind_swe/<file>.cdf
```

### Running the pipeline

```bash
python run_phase1_ingestion.py
python run_phase2_preprocessing.py
python run_phase3_features.py
python run_phase4_dataset_builder.py
python run_phase5_training.py                    # trains XGBoost + LSTM, all 3 horizons
python run_phase6_ensemble.py                    # grid-searches alpha per horizon
python run_phase7_validation.py                  # scores predictions against GRASP ground truth

# Or run pieces individually while iterating:
python run_phase5_training.py --xgb-only --horizon A
python run_phase5_training.py --lstm-only --epochs 30 --sequence-length 288
python run_phase6_ensemble.py --horizon A
python run_phase7_validation.py --horizon A

# Dashboard (reads whatever Phase 1-6/7 artifacts already exist):
streamlit run src/dashboard/app.py
```

XGBoost trains fine on a laptop CPU (~10-30 min for all three horizons). LSTM should be
trained on a GPU - see `TRAINING_GUIDE.md` for free Colab/Kaggle options; the CPU path still
works but is only practical for small smoke tests, not the full multi-year dataset.

Storage note: `auto_fetcher.py` pulls Wind MFI at 1-minute cadence (`WI_H0_MFI`), not the raw
3-second dataset - everything downstream resamples to 5-min anyway, and the 3-second files are
~20x larger for zero accuracy gain (~500MB/month vs ~25MB/month). `run_phase1_ingestion.py
--cleanup-raw` deletes the raw GOES/Wind CDF files after a successful ingestion run to save
disk space further (off by default - you'd need them again to re-run Phase 1; GRASP ZIPs are
never touched since they can't be re-downloaded automatically).

## Key Engineering Decisions

**Log transform (mandatory, no exceptions).** Electron flux spans ~5 orders of magnitude.
Every model sees `log10(flux + 1e-10)`, never raw flux. Predictions are inverse-transformed
back (`10**x`) before being reported.

**Dynamic Lag (signature innovation).** Solar wind doesn't take a fixed time to travel from
the Wind spacecraft (L1) to Earth - it depends on solar wind speed at that moment
(`Δt = ΔX / Vsw`, `ΔX ≈ 1.5×10⁶ km`). Phase 3 computes this per-row and looks *backward* that
many steps for the aligned Wind features - a first-order approximation (using the
contemporaneous, arrival-side speed rather than the true departure-side speed), chosen
deliberately because it's a well-defined, gap-free, and deployable operation. An earlier
forward-scatter design (shifting each Wind reading forward to its estimated arrival time) was
tried and rejected: variable per-row shifts aren't surjective, so it left scattered
destination gaps and dropped ~60% of rows once combined with the later `dropna()`.

**Direct single-output LSTM, one per horizon.** No recursive multi-step prediction, no
seq2seq - each LSTM takes a fixed 288-step (24h) input window and predicts a single scalar
(`log10(flux)`) at `t + horizon`. Recursive prediction was rejected because error compounds
badly over a 6h/12h rollout.

**Chronological splits everywhere.** Never random shuffle for time series - Phase 4's
80/10/10 train/val/test split is a straight chronological cut, preserving temporal order so
validation never leaks future information into training.

**Spike detection uses MAD, not rolling std.** A single extreme value inside its own rolling
window inflates plain `std()` enough to hide itself from a `>5σ` threshold test. Phase 2 uses
median absolute deviation (rescaled by 1.4826 to a normal-consistent sigma) instead, which
stays robust to the very outlier it's trying to detect.

**Rolling window features cover mean/std/max/min + EMA.** Phase 3 computes rolling mean, std,
max, and min of `log_electron_flux` over 6/12/24-step windows, plus an exponential moving
average (`EMA_t = α·x_t + (1-α)·EMA_{t-1}`, `α = 2/(span+1)`) at the same spans - `adjust=False`
is used so pandas computes the exact recursive formula rather than its alternate
early-observation reweighting. Correlation features were considered but not added.

**Ensemble alpha is grid-searched, not fixed.** `P = α·P_LSTM + (1-α)·P_XGB`, with α swept
over `[0.0, 0.1, ..., 1.0]` against the validation split per horizon (Phase 6) - the blend is
never forced to include both models if one is genuinely better; α=0 or α=1 are valid outcomes.
Because XGBoost predicts every row but the LSTM only predicts from row
`sequence_length - 1` onward, the two prediction arrays (and the ground truth) are sliced to
the same overlapping range before blending - a shape mismatch here would silently pair up the
wrong timesteps.

**GRASP validation runs over the full feature history, not the Phase 4 test split.** GRASP's
1-2 year coverage window has no reason to overlap with the last 10% (chronologically) of the
GOES+Wind training period, so Phase 7 re-runs inference over every row of
`training_features.csv`, labels each prediction with the real calendar timestamp it's actually
a forecast *for* (row time + horizon), and matches those against GRASP's own timestamps via a
tolerance-based nearest join (`pd.merge_asof`, ±2.5 min) rather than exact index equality -
GRASP's raw parsed timestamps aren't guaranteed to land on the same 5-min grid boundaries.
Skill score against a persistence baseline (`1 - MSE_model / MSE_persistence`) is computed
against that same matched GRASP ground truth, so model and persistence are scored on
identical rows.

## Data Sources

| Source | Format | Purpose |
|--------|--------|---------|
| GOES satellite (13/15/16) | CDF | Training target: >2 MeV electron flux |
| Wind spacecraft MFI | CDF | Input: IMF Bx, By, Bz (nT, GSE frame) |
| Wind spacecraft SWE | CDF | Input: solar wind speed (km/s), plasma density (cm⁻³) |
| GRASP/GSAT (ISRO) | ZIP → TXT + XML + PNG | Validation only, not used in training |

**Verified CDAWeb dataset IDs** (confirmed live, not from docs - CDAWeb's own naming
conventions have drifted from what's commonly referenced):
- Wind MFI: `WI_H0_MFI` (1-min cadence), variable `BGSE` - used instead of the 3-second
  `WI_H2_MFI` dataset since everything downstream resamples to 5-min anyway
- Wind SWE: `WI_K0_SWE`, variables `V_GSE` (velocity vector, magnitude computed downstream),
  `Np` (density) - the commonly-referenced `Proton_V_nonlin`/`Proton_Np_nonlin` names do not
  exist in this dataset
- GOES-13 >2 MeV electrons: `GOES13_EPEAD-SCIENCE-ELECTRONS-E13EW_1MIN`, variable `E2W_COR_FLUX`
  (2010-05 to 2017-12)
- GOES-15 >2 MeV electrons: `GOES15_EPEAD-SCIENCE-ELECTRONS-E13EW_1MIN`, variable `E2W_COR_FLUX`
  (2010-03 to 2020-03)

Note: the GOES EPEAD >2 MeV corrected channel has a naturally high NaN rate - solar proton
contamination frequently invalidates it (`E2W_DQF` flag). That's expected data behavior, not
a pipeline bug.

## Known Gotchas (found while building this)

These were live, verified bugs fixed during development - worth knowing if you touch the
ingestion or model-saving code:

- **`cdflib` >= 1.0 returns `cdf_info()` as a `CDFInfo` dataclass, not a dict.** Code written
  against the older dict-style API (`info.get("rVariables", [])`) crashes with
  `AttributeError` on every real CDF file. Fixed in `cdf_inspector.py`, `goes_reader.py`,
  `wind_reader.py` to use attribute access (`info.rVariables`).
- **`cdasws`'s `get_data()` returns in-memory data, not file URLs.** `auto_fetcher.py` now
  uses `get_data_file()`, which returns `(status_code, {"FileDescription": [...]})`.
  `get_datasets()`/`get_variables()` also return lists directly, not dict-wrapped results.
- **Keras 3 can't reliably reload a legacy `.h5` model compiled with a string loss.** Loading
  raises `Could not deserialize 'keras.metrics.mse'`. `LSTMTrainer.load()` works around this
  with `compile=False` (fine for `predict()`; pass `recompile=True` if you need `.evaluate()`
  or further training).
- Several unicode arrow/checkmark/em-dash characters in log/print statements crashed or
  garbled on Windows' cp1252 console encoding - replaced with ASCII equivalents throughout.
- **`pd.merge_asof` requires both sides to share the same `datetime64` resolution.** In
  pandas >= 2, `date_range`, CSV `parse_dates`, and `Timedelta` arithmetic can each land on a
  different resolution (`ns` vs `us`), so joining GRASP timestamps against model prediction
  timestamps raised `MergeError: incompatible merge keys`. `grasp_validator.py` normalizes
  both indices to `ns` (`.as_unit("ns")`) before merging.
- **A handful of real CDAWeb records decode to garbage timestamps** (observed: one Wind SWE
  record each at `1998-05-31` and `2055-02-24`, in a file that should only span March 2015).
  Uncaught, these silently pass through `cdflib`'s own fill-value handling and blow up the
  next `pd.resample()` call into millions of rows spanning decades. An absolute
  mission-lifetime bound alone isn't sufficient - `1998-05-31` is a real Wind-era date, just
  the wrong file - so `goes_reader.py`/`wind_reader.py` also require each timestamp be within
  60 days of that file's own median (each CDAWeb file covers one bounded fetch chunk; see
  `auto_fetcher.fetch_dataset`).
- **`pandas` `TimedeltaIndex` has no `.abs()` method** (only `Series` does) - use `np.abs()` or
  the builtin `abs()` on a `TimedeltaIndex` instead.
